you dont know about me without you have read a book by the name of the adventures of tom sawyer but that aint no matter  that book was made by mr mark twain and he told the truth mainly  there was things which he stretched but mainly he told the truth.  That is nothing  i never seen anybody but lied one time or another without it was aunt polly or the widow, or maybe mary aunt polly toms aunt polly she isand mary and the widow douglas is all told about in that book which is mostly a true book with some stretchers as I said before

now the way that the book winds up is this tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave and it made us rich  we got six thousand dollars apiece all gold it was an awful sight of money when it was piled up  well judge thatcher he took it and put it out at interest and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round more than a body could tell what to do with the widow douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me but it was rough living in the house all the time considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways and so when I couldnt stand it no longer i lit out  i got into my old rags and my sugarhogshead again and was free and satisfied  but tom sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers and i might join if i would go back to the widow and be respectable so I went back and i said to him ladeda i
